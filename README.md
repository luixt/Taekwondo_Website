# Taekwondo Website

## Project Description

### Goal
The primary objective of my taekwondo website was to provide comprehensive information about taekwondo, targeting an audience unfamiliar with the martial art. It covered the historical background and technical aspects of taekwondo, helping people understand what to expect if they decide to learn more or start practicing. The website also emphasized the importance of the sport in fostering discipline, promoting physical fitness, and offering self-defense skills.

### Methodology
I started by planning and designing the website, sketching out wireframes to map the layout and user flow. I then built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, testing each feature as I went to catch and fix any errors. The process involved continuous tweaking and adjustments to improve the design and functionality.
